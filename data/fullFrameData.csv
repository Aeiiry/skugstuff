- Activates det mode. While active, a 10 second timer above her head ticks down (90f/second), and Robo-Fortune gains multiple buffs until she explodes, damaging the opponent, and is replaced with a back-up unit. - Her walk, dash, and headrone deployment speeds increase.
- She loses her double jump in exchange for an airdash (8f lockout).
- L/M Beams are faster, do more damage, ground bounce once per combo, and cause sliding knockdown thereafter. - She can also use a new special move called Warranty Extension, which allows her to spend headrones to increase the detonation timer by 5 seconds (up to a maximum of 20 seconds) and reduce her meter gain penalty at the cost of increasing non-recoverable self-damage. - Robo-Fortune detonates immediately once the timer expires, unless she is in a scripted animation such as a successful grab. - The explosion inflicts 2000 recoverable damage to herself.
- IPS tracking and damage scaling are reset when she explodes, but undizzy is not affected.
- Robo receives an additional 20F of invulnerability if she doesn't perform any moves after the activation. While it looks like she is idling, this idle is invicible. Any input will cancel this invuln period.
- When using Magnet to trigger the explosion: the explosion will only combo if OTG has not already been used.
- There is a 10 frame buffer on attacks after the explosion. This allows for a follow up beam super on every character.",https://wiki.gbl.gg/images/1/1b/SG_rfo_qcbpp.png,https://wiki.gbl.gg/images/a/aa/SG_rfo_qcbpp1a_fd.png
